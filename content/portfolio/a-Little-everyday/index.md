## Book Summary
SlowMo  (the sloth) is hopelessly embroiled in finishing all his homework, at one go, in a single day, and is thus getting tensed and worried. The wise Momo (the hedgehog) comes to his rescue, and teaches him how doing things "a little every day" not only reduces the burden, but allows us to do and learn many things, each passing day, with ease and enjoyment.
